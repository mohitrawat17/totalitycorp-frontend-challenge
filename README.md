Hello,
This is an intermediate-level e-commerce website(Shoppy).

I've built this project as a part of front-end challenge from Totality-Corp.
The main objective was to build the frontend using React and Redux. I have used Tailwindcss for styling components. 

Tech Stack :
1) HTML5/CSS3
2) JavaScript (ES6+)
3) ReactJS
4) Redux (state management)
5) Tailwindcss
6) npm packages
7) Vercel
8) fakestore API

Usage :
Clone the repo and run `npm install` to get all dependencies installed on your local machine then you can start using it by running `npm start`.

UI explain : 
1) first user has to signup/register.
2) then using the same username and password used in registration, the user has to login in the app
3) after successful login, the user can see all products available on the site.
4)to add product on the cart, user has to click the add button on the product
5) once added successfully, the user will be able to view his/her shopping cart items by clicking "Cart" link at top right corner.
6)user can remove product, add more product or remove all product from the cart.
8)after adding items into the cart ,the total price will be displayed at side by side.
9)if user wants to checkout, he has to click on "checkout" button which redirects him to payment page where he can pay for his orders.
